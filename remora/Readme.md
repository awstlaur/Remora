# Racket prototype
This is the untyped array calculus from the ESOP'14 [paper](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/jrslepak/typed-j.pdf), extended with an application form that permits an explicit shape annotation. Our goal for this phase is to come up with enough practical sample code to properly form design goals for a type inference pass.

## Installation
From a standard Racket install, run
`raco pkg install git://github.com/jrslepak/Remora.git/?path=remora`

**Or** using DrRacket's package manager window, install `git://github.com/jrslepak/Remora.git/?path=remora`

## Starting out
The package documentation includes a tutorial and reference describing syntax and built-in operators.
